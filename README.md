# DiscordBot
This project is very old and outdated. I am working on refining this bot overtime and updating to for the latest discord standards and making it work with the latest libraries. **This bot is designed for a single server, while the end goal is for this bot to work with any server, the main focus at the moment is for the Bonk SMP Discord Server.** Originally back in 2022, I used Oterlu API to filter content however since then that company was aquirement by Reddit. Another option at the time was GPT-3, however it much much more expensive to use the API before it became very popular. Now GPT-4 Turbo seems like a better option for filtering. I am also looking mroe into moving from the old /sell commands you typed and sent to actual supported discord /commands as this is now a requirement by Discord. I will most likely use interactions.py.

**PROJECT MOVED! Work in progress at https://discord.gg/bonknetwork . Code is sometimes running on the bot named Mod Bot. The GitHub repo is private.**
