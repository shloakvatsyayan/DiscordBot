# DiscordBot
In this project by me and two of my friends, we are making a Discord bot. Please note that this bot is still in it's alpha stage and is not that big. It doesn't have many commands either yet. If you have no idea what we're talking about and what we mean by commands, we're guessing you don't know what discord is or don't use it. Let us explain it for those who don't know or don't use it. Discord is a gaming communication platform. You can text, use voice chat, video calls, game overlays, and many more amazing gaming features. Bots can only be added to servers. If you didn't understand what we said about discord we don't either so go to https://discord.com for their site. Ok, now back to the bot. The bot is ment to give command for a YT channel and add moderation to the server. That's basicly it. Yeah, it's super small. IMPORTANT: DO NOT LOOK IN "not_allowed_words.py"!!! Since this bot is currently only set up for a certain server and not custamizable without editing the code, we are not sharing the invite link to the bot. This uses a python library called discord.py .
