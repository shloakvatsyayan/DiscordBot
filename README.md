# DiscordBot
In this project by me(SSVF112 Playz, go check out my YT channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-1IzGS1Va2-r6Bs2W-Lf4g) and a friend we are making a discord bot. This is mainly for SSVF112 Playz's YT discord server so most of the commands like !ssvf112playzwebsite are made for SSVF112's channel. Please note this bot is still in it's beta stage and is not that big. It doesn't have many commands either yet. If you have no idea what we're talking about and what we mean by commands, we're geussing you don't know what discord is or don't use it. Let us explain for those who don't know or don't use it. Discord is a gaming communication platform. You can text, use voice chat, video calls, game overlay, and many more amazing gaming features. Specificly bots can only be added to servers. If you didn't understand what we said about discord we don't either so go to https://discord.com for their site. Ok now bck to the bot. The bot is ment to give command for my YT channel and add moderation to the server. That's basicly it. Yeah, it's super small.
